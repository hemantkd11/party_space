      One problem with this example is that we are adding a new method showData
      on the cars object and we might not want to do that just to borrow a
      method because the cars object might already have a property or method
      name showData. We donâ€™t want to overwrite it accidentally. As we will see
      in our discussion of Apply and Call below, it is best to borrow a method
      using either the Apply or Call method.
